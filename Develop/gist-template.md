# Regex-Walkthrough
This tutorial introduces the intricacies of regular expressions, or regex for short. Throughout this guide, we will delve into the different elements that compose regex patterns, offering comprehensive explanations and practical examples to enhance your understanding of their functionality.

## Summary

In this guide, we will explore the complex world of regular expressions. Our journey will include an examination of key components including anchors, quantifiers, the OR operator, character classes, flags, as well as concepts of grouping and capturing, bracket expressions, both greedy and lazy matching techniques, boundaries, back-references, and the advanced look-ahead and look-behind mechanisms.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors, symbolized by "^" for the start and "$" for the end, are used to assert particular positions within the text being searched. The caret "^" specifies that the matching should begin at the start of a line, while the dollar sign "$" indicates that the matching should conclude at the end of a line. These markers are crucial for confirming that the regex pattern matches the entire input from beginning to end.

Example:

Input: john.doe@example.com Explanation: The "^" anchor guarantees that the matching process commences right at the start of the string.

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers in regular expressions are used to define how many times the element preceding them should appear. The most common quantifiers include "+" for one or more times, "*" for zero or more times, "?" for zero or one time, "{n}" for exactly n times, "{n,}" for at least n times, and "{n,m}" for a range of n to m times.

"+" signifies one or more occurrences.
"*" indicates zero or more occurrences.
"?" denotes zero or one occurrence.
"{n}" requires exactly n occurrences.
"{n,}" allows for n or more occurrences.
"{n,m}" specifies a range from n to m occurrences.
